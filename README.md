# Recommendation-system-for-ecommerce

### Problem statement
It is commonplace for electronic commerce platforms to ask their users to rate and review the products they offer. Users typically check these product reviews for positive responses or higher ratings from other purchasers, to help determine whether a product is considered good to buy, or for negative responses or lower ratings to help determine whether a product is not considered a good buy. As a result, both ratings (numbers) and reviews (text) can be used to generate better product recommendations instead of relying only on ratings. In this way, a defining characteristic of better product recommendations is that whatever products are suggested by the recommendation system should have positive sentiment as well.
